                <h2>What Equipment Do You Need?</h2>
                <img src="../images/saltwater.jpg" alt="Saltwater Fishing Made Easy">
                <p>Having the right gear is crucial for a successful saltwater fishing experience. Here are the basics you'll need:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Rod and Reel:</strong>
                        <p>Saltwater rods and reels are designed to withstand the harsh conditions of the ocean. They are typically more robust and corrosion-resistant. Common types include spinning rods, baitcasting rods, and surf rods. A medium-heavy spinning rod and reel is a versatile choice for beginners.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Fishing Line:</strong>
                        <p>Braid and monofilament lines are commonly used in saltwater fishing. Braid is known for its strength and sensitivity, while monofilament is more forgiving and easier to handle. Choose a line strength based on your target species, typically between 20-50 lb test for most saltwater fishing.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bait:</strong>
                        <p>Live bait such as shrimp, squid, and baitfish are highly effective. Artificial baits like soft plastics, jigs, and topwater lures are also popular choices. The choice of bait often depends on the species you are targeting.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Other Essentials:</strong>
                        <p>Bring a tackle box, fishing license, pliers, a first aid kit, and a cooler for your catch. Don't forget sun protection, appropriate clothing for the weather, and plenty of water.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Saltwater Fish Species</h2>
                <p>Saltwater bodies are home to a variety of fish species. Here are some common ones:</p>
                <h3>Yellow-Tail Bream:</h3>
                <img src="../images/bream.jpg" alt="Yellow-Tail Bream">
                <p>Recognizable by its silver body and yellow-tinted fins, the Yellow-Tail Bream typically inhabits Australia's estuaries, bays, and coastal waters.</p>
                <h3>Threadfin Salmon:</h3>
                <img src="../images/salmon.jpg" alt="Threadfin Salmon">
                <p>Distinguished by their elongated pectoral fins that resemble threads and a silvery body with a slightly flattened profile, Threadfin Salmon are a popular target species for the strength they exhibit. Threadfin Salmon can be found in coastal waters, estuaries, and rivers near muddy or sandy bottoms where they can hunt for crustaceans and small fishes.</p>
                <h3>Jewfish (Mulloway):</h3>
                <img src="../images/jewie2.jpg" alt="Jewfish">
                <p>A large, silver-scaled fish with a distinctive humpbacked appearance, the Jewfish is prized by anglers for its fighting ability and size. They are typically found in estuaries, bays, and coastal waters. They prefer deeper holes and channels where they can ambush prey.</p>
                <h3>Bullshark:</h3>
                <img src="../images/bullshark.jpg" alt="Bullshark">
                <p>Bullsharks are a large, aggressive shark known for their stout body and blunt, rounded snout. They have a grey top and white underbelly, which helps them blend into their surroundings from above and below. Bull sharks are one of the few shark species that can thrive in both saltwater and freshwater, making them unique among sharks. They are typically found in warm, shallow waters along coastlines, in bays, and in rivers. They are known to travel far upstream in freshwater rivers and have been found thousands of miles from the ocean. This adaptability allows them to exploit a wide range of environments.</p>
